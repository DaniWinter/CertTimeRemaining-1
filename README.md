# CertTimeManager by lululombard

This crapy tool tells you when your yalu102 will expire.

Compiled with LLVM+Clang on an iPhone 5s running iOS 10.2.

The icon is not really mine but it was licenced under wtfpl so no big deal.

# Known issues

The icon may not show up, run `uicache` as mobile or `su mobile -c uicache` as root, in your terminal, if this issue occurs.
