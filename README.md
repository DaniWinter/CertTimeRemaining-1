Hello World
===========
Made for jailbroken iOS, and [Theos](https://github.com/DHowett/theos)

Notes
-----

 - Create a symbolic link, `theos`, to where you installed theos.
 - Since I customized my theos installation, this may not compile out-of-box.
   - ARC is enabled here, and it requires -lstdc++
   - Stock LLVM and Clang from Debian testing are used to compile this on my
     machine
